# Introduction

I have long dreamed to systematize all information I gather when
solving day-to-day issues with my Gentoo system. Despite the increased
documentation quality of the Gentoo wiki, not to forget the Arch wiki, plus the
improved system tools, it is still a lot of effort to track down the source of
particular option or hack I have used and thus the reason behind creating this
repository.
